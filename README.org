#+TITLE: Asteroids

This is just a simple pygame application that recreates the classic game
"Asteroids".

This program was created while following along with the course on [[https://www.boot.dev/u/maker2413][Boot.dev]].

To run the game you will need to do the following:
#+begin_src shell
  python3 -m venv venv

  source venv/bin/activate

  pip install -r requirements.txt

  python3 main.py
#+end_src
